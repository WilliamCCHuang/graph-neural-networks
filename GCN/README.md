# Graph Convolutional Networks

## Reproduce

If you want to reproduce the result in the paper: [SEMI-SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION WITH GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJU4ayYgl), use the following command to train a GCN model trained on Cora dataset with default parameters:

```
$ python train.py accuracy --dataset Cora
```
